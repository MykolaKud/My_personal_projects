In this repository, I have collected all my personal completed projects.

I am an aspiring data analyst passionate about exploring and uncovering insights from data. These projects showcase my ability to analyze diverse datasets using various tools and techniques I have mastered. Each project reflects my curiosity, problem-solving skills, and commitment to continuous learning in the field of data analytics.

I enjoy working with data to transform raw information into meaningful insights, leveraging SQL, Python, Excel, and visualization tools like Power BI or Tableau. My goal is to apply these skills to real-world challenges and contribute to data-driven decision-making.
